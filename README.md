# Grand Theft Candy
Jump into the world of Grand Theft Candy. Collect candy and escape the police, can you make it to the highscore?

Items:
- Candy Cane: +2 Points
- Brokkoli: -10 Points
- Lightning: Speed Player up
- Snow Flake: Slows Player down
- Bomb: Collect and place the bomb whenever you want. A placed bomb detonates when the police is around.
- Star: Makes the player invincible for a few seconds and destroys police by contact
--> Destroyed Police Car: +10 Points

We implemented 4 different police movement patterns. These patterns vary with increasing score. The further you get, the harder the game will be. We integrated Firebase for the highscore funtionality.
